# Elixir hackathon - project 30:

Welcome to project 30 !

## Dev environment

For the development, we can either use your own machine or a VM we setup for you.

### Use a VM

The VMs technical specifications are:
- a P100 GPU
- 60Gb RAM
TODO: complete this

and software-wise:
- Debian 10
- Python 3.7
TODO: complete this

You can install any package you want on the VMs, they are yours for the duration of the hackathon
and will be deleted afterwards.

To connect to the VM, ask us for the IP and private SSH key. Then you can connect to the VM with the following command:
```sh
ssh user@VM_IP -i path/to/private/key
```

### Use your own computer

If you use your own machine, you need the following:
- work on Linux or Mac, we do not support Windows
- have Docker installed and configured, be comfortable with Docker running as root
- Python 3.7 or higher

We will give you access to the libraries:
- TODO: give path to wheels + how to install them
